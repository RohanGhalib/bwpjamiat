## 2024-05-18 - Optimized sortEventsBySchedule and getEventState
**Learning:** `sortEventsBySchedule` recalculates `getEventStartTime` (which calls `Date.parse`) inside the `.sort` comparison function. Array sorts take O(N log N) time, so doing an expensive parse on every comparison is very inefficient. `getEventState` and the loop inside `sortEventsBySchedule` instantiate `new Date()` and `Date.now()` repeatedly.
**Action:** Map events to their parsed times before sorting them to avoid repeated string parsing. Pass down `now` or evaluate `Date.now()` and `new Date()` outside of loops.

## 2024-05-22 - Missing sizes attribute on Image components with fill
**Learning:** In Next.js, when using the `<Image>` component with the `fill` layout, if the `sizes` attribute is omitted, the browser assumes the image will occupy the full width of the viewport (`100vw`). This leads to the browser downloading unnecessarily large images for components that only occupy a fraction of the screen, significantly impacting load times and increasing bandwidth consumption.
**Action:** Always explicitly define a `sizes` attribute for `<Image>` components using `fill` to provide the browser with accurate information about the image's intended display size at different breakpoints, allowing it to select the most optimal image size.

## 2026-05-23 - Replace native img tag with Next.js Image component
**Learning:** Replacing native `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` components allows Next.js to apply automatic optimizations like WebP conversion, responsive resizing, and lazy loading, which can significantly improve page load performance. Native `<img>` tags might cause slower LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) and higher bandwidth usage.
**Action:** Always prefer the Next.js `<Image>` component over the native `<img>` tag unless there is a specific reason not to.

## 2026-06-24 - Prevented excessive re-renders during audio playback
**Learning:** In the `TaranasGallery` component, the audio element's `timeupdate` event was triggering state updates (`setProgress`, `setCurrentTimeRaw`, `setDurationRaw`) multiple times per second. This caused the entire gallery component (which maps over many elements) to re-render constantly, leading to a massive CPU overhead.
**Action:** Replaced `useState` for high-frequency updates with `useRef`. Attached refs to the specific DOM elements (spans for text, divs for progress bars) and directly mutated their `textContent` and `style.width` properties inside the `handleTimeUpdate` function. This completely eliminated the React re-render cycle for time tracking while preserving the UI update, drastically improving performance.
