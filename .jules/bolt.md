## 2024-05-18 - Optimized sortEventsBySchedule and getEventState
**Learning:** `sortEventsBySchedule` recalculates `getEventStartTime` (which calls `Date.parse`) inside the `.sort` comparison function. Array sorts take O(N log N) time, so doing an expensive parse on every comparison is very inefficient. `getEventState` and the loop inside `sortEventsBySchedule` instantiate `new Date()` and `Date.now()` repeatedly.
**Action:** Map events to their parsed times before sorting them to avoid repeated string parsing. Pass down `now` or evaluate `Date.now()` and `new Date()` outside of loops.

## 2024-05-22 - Missing sizes attribute on Image components with fill
**Learning:** In Next.js, when using the `<Image>` component with the `fill` layout, if the `sizes` attribute is omitted, the browser assumes the image will occupy the full width of the viewport (`100vw`). This leads to the browser downloading unnecessarily large images for components that only occupy a fraction of the screen, significantly impacting load times and increasing bandwidth consumption.
**Action:** Always explicitly define a `sizes` attribute for `<Image>` components using `fill` to provide the browser with accurate information about the image's intended display size at different breakpoints, allowing it to select the most optimal image size.
